map() → transforms and returns a new array.

forEach() → just loops, no new array.

filter() → selects elements and returns a new array.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
ans:
An arrow function is a modern, lightweight function expression introduced in ES6 that makes code shorter and handles this differently from normal functions.

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
ans :
Destructuring lets you pick pieces of data out of an object or array and assign them to variables quickly, instead of accessing them one by one.

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
